# ✨ Day 41 – HTML Basics ✨

Welcome to **Day 41** of the [100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu. Today, we take a brief detour into the world of web development by exploring the fundamentals of HTML.

---

## 🧳 Project Overview

In this session, we delve into the basics of HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages. The focus is on understanding and implementing various HTML elements to structure content effectively.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills

- **HTML5**: Structuring web content with semantic elements
- **Basic Web Development**: Understanding the building blocks of web pages ([Complete Python Pro Bootcamp ...](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

├── heading_elements/
│   └── index.html           # Demonstrates various heading tags

├── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Heading Elements**: The `index.html` file inside the `heading_elements` directory showcases the use of different heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to define headings of varying importance.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Heading Elements</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>This is an H1 heading</h1>
       <h2>This is an H2 heading</h2>
       <h3>This is an H3 heading</h3>
       <h4>This is an H4 heading</h4>
       <h5>This is an H5 heading</h5>
       <h6>This is an H6 heading</h6>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Basic HTML Page**: The `hellow.html` file is a simple HTML document that includes basic elements such as paragraphs, links, and images to demonstrate how to structure a web page.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Hello World</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is a paragraph in HTML.</p>
       <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

---

## 📌 How to View the Pages

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2tzz/100Days_Python_Udemy.git
   cd 100Days_Python_Udemy/Logs/day41
   ```

2. **Open HTML Files**:

   - Navigate to the `heading_elements` directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to view the heading elements.
   - Open `hellow.html` in your web browser to see the basic HTML page.

---

## 📬 Notes

- **HTML Structure**: Ensure that each HTML file starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and includes the necessary `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Semantic Elements**: Using appropriate heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) helps in defining the structure and improving the accessibility of your web pages.
