# Day 30 - Python Udemy 100 Days Challenge

## Overview
This project is part of the **100 Days of Python Udemy Course**, specifically focusing on Day 30. The goal of this day's challenge is to **enhance the Password Manager GUI** developed on **Day 29** by adding additional features such as data persistence using JSON.

## Differences from Day 29
The major improvements and differences compared to the previous **Day 29 Password Manager** include:
- **Data Persistence with JSON**: Instead of storing passwords in a text file, data is now stored in a structured JSON format.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for saved credentials by entering a website name, making retrieval easier.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Better input validation and error handling for missing fields or invalid data.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Refinements in the graphical interface for a smoother user experience.

## Project Details
- **Topic:** Advanced Password Manager with JSON Storage
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - GUI Development using Tkinter
